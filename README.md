<h1>Study Notes</h1>

======

<p>
    Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <br>
    My name is Mazen, I've recently finished the <a href="http://www.iti.gov.eg/iti/programs/details/ICCG">ITI Intensive Training Program</a>, Full Stack Web Developer Using MEARN track (yes! Angular and ReactðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…)<br>
    These are my study notes from the lectures, I thought I'd share them publicly so others could make a use of them too.<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

NB:
- Although I'm done the training program, I didn't have enough time then to write everything that I've learnt through out the course,<br>
right now I'm in the process of going over everything I learnt and hopefully I'll be adding more and more content in the next few weeks

- I've also decided to keep using this repo as my own documentation, so I'll be adding stuff beyond the scope of what I've learnt in the program

- Lastly, feel free to contribute and edit any mistake you might find ðŸ˜„
